# 🧰 dev-kit

A personal monorepo for building and experimenting with frontends, APIs, utilities, and shared libraries.

This is my digital workshop — a place to tinker 🛠, test 🧪, and explore ideas 💡.  
Everything lives here in one organized space, from UI components to backend services.

### ⚙️ Tech Stack

- 🧩 **pnpm workspaces** — fast and efficient dependency management  
- 🚀 **Turborepo** — task orchestration with caching  
- 🧠 **TypeScript** — consistent types across everything  
- 🧹 **ESLint & Prettier** — clean and readable code

### 📌 Notes

This is a personal workspace — some things are experiments, others are just ideas in progress.  
Feel free to browse or borrow, but don’t expect everything to be production-ready 😉
