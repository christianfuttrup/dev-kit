# dev-kit

A personal monorepo for building and experimenting with frontends, APIs, utilities, and shared libraries.

This is where I explore ideas, structure code, and refine tooling — from component libraries to backend services.

## Tooling

- **pnpm workspaces** for dependency management
- **Turborepo** for build orchestration
- **TypeScript** for all projects
- **ESLint & Prettier** for consistent code style

## Notes

This is a personal workspace — not everything here is production-ready.  
Some projects are for learning, testing, or idea prototyping.
